The objective of this dataset is to predict car prices based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.The dataset consists of several car predictor variables and one target variable 'selling_price'. Predictor variables includes year, km_driven, fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner, etc

I have used various Machine Learning Algorithms to predict car prices and selected the best ML model whose accuracy score is highest of all.
